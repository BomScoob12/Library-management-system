#### Properties:
* books: stores all books in an array
    * Methods:
        * addBook(title, author, genre, publishedYear): adds a new book to the end of the books array, auto-generates an isbn, and returns the new book object

        * findBooksByGenre(genre): returns an array of books from a particular genre
        * topRatedBooks(n): returns the top 'n' books sorted by their average ratings
        * recentlyPublished(): returns books published in the last 5 years, sorted by their published year

### Advanced Practice Exercises:
* Add Multiple Genres: Update the addBook method to accept multiple genres for a book. Modify the findBooksByGenre method to return books that have any of the provided genres.

* Complex Search: Write a function that takes a query string and searches for it in book titles, authors, and genres, and returns matching books.

* Rating a Book: Given an isbn, userId, and a rating, use the rateBook method to add a new rating or update an existing one.

* Top Rated Authors: Write a function that returns the top 'n' authors based on the average ratings of all their books.

* Recommendation System: Based on the genres of the books rated highest by a user, recommend other books from those genres which the user hasn't rated yet.

* Analytics - Genre Popularity: Write a function that provides a breakdown of books in the library by genre. The result should be an object where keys are genres and values are the number of books in each genre.

* Advanced Filtering: Write a function that returns all books that meet certain criteria, e.g., books by a particular author, published between certain years, and having an average rating above a certain value.
